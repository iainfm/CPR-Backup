Version 1.0.1

Moved the code that waits for rsync to finish into a little subroutine. It's started to be used
more often that I thought.

Corrected a bug in the last part of the script (wasn't updating $rsync_running in the loop).

Version 1.0.2

Added email report options.

Version 1.0.2a

Fixed a bug. I was calling wait_for_rsync without () brackets. Oopsy.

Version 1.0.2b

Changed the error detection strings to avoid it thinking filenames containing these strings were
error conditions.

Version 1.0.3

Some testing was done with older version of NetWare. 6.0 and 6.0SP2 failed, but SP3 and newer seem
to be OK.

Implemented log file rollover.
Added log file parsing.

Version 1.0.4

Added options to repeat tasks (might be better for clustered servers where you don't know which
volumes are going to be where...

Version 1.0.5

Skips volumes if they are not mounted (useful for clusters). Optionally warns and logs.
Tided up code/indents etc (found Open Perl IDE - no more notepad! :-) )

Moved the Stop-file test to its own subroutine

Removed a superfluous sleep() command in the Minimal version

Version 1.0.6

Added the ability to specify user-defined rsync options in the targets file. Format is:
[option1,option2,option3....]

eg

[-rav,--progress,--backup,--suffix=".1"]

Version 1.0.7

UCS method of determining whether an NLM is loaded has been replaced by checking the NRM XML files.
Thanks to Larry Bernstone for suggesting this!

*** For this reason, NSS must be present on the server and NRM functioning (check for the folder _ADMIN:Novell\NRM). ***
*** If you don't have NSS volumes, continue using the 1.0.6 version ***

CPRBackup-M has been removed from the distribution, as it was found that installing Perl 5.8 on older
NetWare servers cured the crashing problems.

Version 1.0.8

Added the ability to direct cprbackup to automatically expand a given target. Put a '>' at the beginning of the line
of the target to expand. To recurse further, simply add more >'s.

Version 1.0.9

Modified the auto-expansion routine to ignore current and parent (. and ..) folders that are returned by NW6.5 SP4.
