CPR-Backup - an example scenario
================================

I say 'example' - I actually mean *my* scenario ;-)

My environment consists (mainly) of a 2-node Netware 6.5 cluster holding various volumes of user
data. The volumes that hold a lot of files and data, I choose to break up into bite-sized chunks
using the '>' directive in the targets file. Files are rsync'd to another 6.5 server in the same
tree.

The two cluster nodes both run the same CPR-Backup script, with the same target files.

Because the volumes are clustered I don't know which node they will be hosted on, so I let it
try them all and skip the ones that aren't there. (I've turned off warning reporting in
the script).

On each node, I have the following Crontab file in SYS:ETC\

   #Minute      Hour    Day of Month    Month   Day of Wk       Command
   #0-59        0-12    1-31            1-12    0-7 (Sun=0,7)   whatever.ncf

   # The DATA1 pool backup (APPS and MISC volumes)
   0,30         5-22    *               *       *               data1.ncf

   # The DATA2 pool backup (SMCA and USER volumes)
   15,45        5-22    *               *       *               data2.ncf

   # The MGMT pool backup  (NDPS and IT volumes)
   0            4       *               *       *               mgmt.ncf

   # Backup the trustees weekly
   0            1       *               *       6               savetrust.ncf


So, as you can see from this every day on the hour and half-hour between 5am and 10pm the 'data1'
NCF file executes. On the 1/4-past and 1/4-to the hour the 'data2' NCF file executes and at 4am
every morning the 'mgmt' script executes. Trustee assignments are saved weekly at 1am on
Saturday morning.

I choose to call an NCF file from the cron job rather than the command itself because I may want
to add or edit what happens at what time. It's just neater, that's all.

My 4 NCF files are held in SYS:SYSTEM and look like this:


   # DATA1 NCF script
   # Called from crontab
   perl --autodestroy SYS:CPRBACKUP.PL SYS:DATA1SRVR.TXT


   # DATA2 NCF script
   # Called from crontab
   perl --autodestroy SYS:CPRBACKUP.PL SYS:DATA2SRVR.TXT


   # MGMT NCF script
   # Called from crontab
   perl --autodestroy SYS:CPRBACKUP.PL SYS:MGMTSRVR.TXT

   # SaveTrust NCF script
   # Called from crontab - saves trustees to SYS:Trustees\<VolumeName>.txt
   perl --autodestroy SYS:SAVETRUST.PL


Having the scripts separate from the Crontab also has the advantage that they can be tested
easily - just run them from the command line.

Finally, my 3 target files are:

   # Targets for cprbackup.pl - DATA1 pool volumes
   # Format is Volume,Source,Destination
   [-ravR,--delete]
   >APPS:,/,SPEY::APPS
   [-rav,--delete]
   MISC:,/,SPEY::MISC
   SYS:,Trustees,SPEY::TRUSTEES
   #End

   # Targets for cprbackup.pl - DATA2 pool volumes
   # Format is Volume,Source,Destination
   #
   # Split the SMCA volume into bite-sized chunks...
   [-ravR,--delete]
   >>SMCA:,/,SPEY::CLIENT
   # Do each user folder separately
   >USER:,/,SPEY::USER
   # Copy trustees
   [-rav,--delete]
   SYS:,Trustees,SPEY::TRUSTEES
   #End

   # Targets for cprbackup.pl - MGMT pool volumes
   # Format is Volume,Source,Destination
   IT:,/,SPEY::IT
   NDPS:,/,SPEY::NDPS
   #End
